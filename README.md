# Monkey-Species-Classification
Built a Convolutional Neural Network model to classify New World Monkey species into their respective categories.

I was inspired by recent vacation trips I took to Costa Rica and Colombia to build a CNN Model on New World Monkeys. Old World Monkeys, Lemurs and Great Apes not included.

This dataset is taken from Kaggle and it consists of the various species of monkeys.
Due to the large volume of data, the images were converted to the images.npy file and the labels are also placed in Labels.csv, allowing you to work on the data without being concerned about the large data volume.
The dataset comprises of 10 monkey species.
